The primary focus of IIPC is to interact with elite\r\n          industries in Delhi and NCR, and extend the efforts in establishing\r\n          partnership with industries across the country in near future.\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className=\"facility-page-image-container\">\r\n          <div className=\"facility-page-image-1\"></div>\r\n          <div className=\"facility-page-image-2-container\">\r\n            <div className=\"facility-page-image-2\"></div>\r\n            <div className=\"facility-page-image-2\"></div>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className=\"director-page-main-content\">\r\n          <p>\r\n            The objective of the IIP Cell is to reduce the gap between industry\r\n            expectations (practice) and academic offerings (theory) by direct\r\n            involvement of industry to attain a symbiosis.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Indian industry at present has reached the most crucial turning\r\n            point where it has to face the dynamic demands of the competitive\r\n            domestic and global markets through the provisions of high quality\r\n            products and services.
